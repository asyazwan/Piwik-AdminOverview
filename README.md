# AdminOverview

## Why

Because default superuser/admin page goes to settings... no such thing as dashboard!

## Installation

1. Download
1. Extract AdminOverview folder in piwik/plugins/ folder


## Features

- List users and their access type and count
- Click a user to view what site(s) they have access to

That's it for now, [request features](http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/1978) you think is good to have as overview.
